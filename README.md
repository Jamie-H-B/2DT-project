we have decided to make a 2D platformer on unity for our 2022 Programing assessment. The focus of this game will be to entertain and tell a story, also to teach ourselves how to use unity. we went with making a 2D game as we thought that it related to us all as we all enjoy playing games and we know a little bit about the way they work. The tools and sites that we will be using are: Miro, Trello, Github, and unity.
